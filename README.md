# raid-bot
A discord bot for raid management; splits, debts owed, rosters, etc.

This is one half creating a useful discord bot for myself and one half learning Java. If you see anything in this repository that looks like terrible java practice... that's because it probably is.

DEPENDENCIES
You will need Gradle to build this. You will also need somewhere persistent to run this, which is typical for Discord bots. The intent is for this to use an on-disk embedded database, so all of your information will be kept alive when/if it shuts down.
